This OSINT tracker tool is designed to identify and monitor sensitive data that has been leaked online. It leverages open-source intelligence techniques to scan publicly accessible areas of the internet, including the surface web, deep web, and dark web, for exposed information.

Key Features:

Continuous Monitoring: The tool actively and continuously scans a wide range of online sources for leaked data. This includes monitoring forums, marketplaces, paste sites, social media, and publicly accessible databases where sensitive information might be disclosed. Real-time alerts notify users when potential leaks are detected.   
Sensitive Data Identification: It is equipped to identify various types of sensitive data, such as:
Credentials (usernames and passwords)
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses
Financial data (credit card numbers, bank account details)
Confidential business information (internal documents, trade secrets)
Government-related sensitive data
Source Analysis: The tool provides insights into where the leaked data was found, offering context about the potential source and severity of the breach. This helps in understanding the scope and impact of the leak.
Alert and Notification System: When sensitive data related to the user's specified parameters is detected, the tool generates timely alerts. These notifications can be customized based on the type and severity of the leaked information.
Reporting and Analysis: The tool often includes features for generating reports on identified leaks, tracking trends, and analyzing the exposed data to understand potential risks and vulnerabilities.
Integration Capabilities: Some advanced tools can integrate with other security systems to automate incident response workflows based on the identified leaked data.   
How it Works:

The OSINT tracker employs various techniques, including:

Web Scraping: Automatically extracting information from websites and online platforms.
Dark Web Monitoring: Utilizing specialized methods to access and monitor hidden services and forums on the dark web.
Database Dumps Analysis: Identifying and parsing publicly leaked database dumps to find sensitive records.
API Integrations: Connecting with various data sources and services to gather intelligence.
Keyword and Pattern Recognition: Using predefined keywords, regular expressions, and sometimes machine learning to identify specific types of sensitive data.
Use Cases:

Data Breach Detection: Organizations can use these tools to identify if their sensitive data or customer data has been compromised and leaked online, allowing for quicker incident response.   
Threat Intelligence: Security teams can monitor for leaked credentials or confidential information that could be used by threat actors for malicious purposes.
Brand Protection: Identifying leaks of proprietary information or sensitive business data that could harm a company's reputation or competitive advantage.
Supply Chain Risk Management: Monitoring for leaks associated with third-party vendors or partners that could indirectly impact an organization.
Personal Security: Individuals can use certain tools or services to check if their personal information has been exposed in data breaches.   
Ethical Considerations:

It's crucial to note that while using OSINT to monitor for leaked data is generally legal as it involves publicly available information, ethical considerations are paramount. Responsible use includes:   

Respecting Privacy: Even when data is public, avoid unnecessary collection or dissemination of personal information.
Data Accuracy: Ensure the accuracy of the identified leaks before taking action.
Transparency: Be transparent about the purpose of monitoring and the use of the collected information, where appropriate.
Legal Compliance: Adhere to all relevant data protection laws and regulations in your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR).
Examples of OSINT Tools with Data Breach Monitoring Capabilities:

While specific tools focus on various aspects of OSINT, some popular tools often used for data breach monitoring include:

Have I Been Pwned? (HIBP): A free service that allows users to check if their email addresses or passwords have been compromised in known data breaches.
DeHashed: A search engine for leaked databases and compromised credentials, offering more extensive search options.
Intelligence X: A powerful search engine that indexes the web, dark web, and various data leaks for specific selectors like emails, domains, and IP addresses.   
SpiderFoot: An automated OSINT collection tool that can gather intelligence from numerous sources, including those related to data breaches.   
Cyble Odin: A commercial tool focused on internet scanning and real-time threat detection, including monitoring for leaked data.   
Breachsense: A platform specializing in real-time data breach and dark web monitoring for organizations.   
These tools vary in their features, cost, and focus, but they all aim to provide insights into the exposure of sensitive data online to help mitigate potential risks.
